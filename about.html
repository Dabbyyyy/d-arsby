      <h2>About D’Arsby</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>D’Arsby</strong>, my personal corner of the internet dedicated to reviewing media that deserves to be celebrated — or called out. Whether it’s movies, TV shows, books, video games, or anime, I’ve created this space to highlight the very best and the absolute worst, all with a consistent visual-first approach and an opinionated rating system. If you’re tired of bland star ratings and vague summaries, you’re in the right place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The D'Arsby idea is simple: criticism needs to be thoughtful, honest, and wtih a bit of fun and personality. I believe that calling out the good is as important as calling out the ordinary and the less-than-stellar, if not sometimes more pleasant. This blog came from the necessity of writing reviews that are not only useful but also a joy to read through, set out clearly and in order so that one can easily find new joys (or prevent disasters).
      </p>

      <p>
        What different about D'Arsby is that I have tried to combine visual design with opinionated curation. The home page includes new and highest-rated reviews in one view. The Hall of Fame has exceptional masterpieces within each category (the top three), and the Hall of Shame is a tongue-in-cheek roast of the worst of the worst (the bottom three). My <a href = "rating_system.html">rating system</a> is rigorous, clear, and explains what every score actually represents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each poster you see on this website is a clickable link that leads you to an in-depth review that discusses the strengths and weaknesses of that work. The Search page enables you to filter by genre and sort by rating or date added, making it simple to find whatever is of interest to you. Everything is written to enable navigation to feel effortless and focused.
      </p>

      <p>
        D'Arsby is my own personal project — a as person who's always had a passion for stories and the art of visual storytelling, I've spent hours on end watching, reading, playing, and over-analyzing every piece of media I consume. This website is where I take all that nitpicking and turn it into something cohesive and hopefully enjoyable to read.
